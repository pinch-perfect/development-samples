Provides a series of projects to offer a gradual progression of development practices for SharePoint

SharePoint has been around for a while.  You may have started in the early days with Full Trust code, User Controls, Pages, Timer Jobs, Workflow, InfoPath, etc.  The list is limitless and so is the opportunity to develop for SharePoint.  The biggest dilemma a programmer will face when approaching SharePoint is Time and frankly Where to start.  The goal of this blog series is to walk through the progression of how an app can transform from early development to modern practices.  The first part of this blog series is to address some common patterns and suggestions as we move towards the Modern Web and in reality the distributed device environment.

Each blog post will contain a set of sample code to assist in the setup, configuration, and deployment of the code.  
This is an extended set of samples based on the OfficeDev PnP Core and Powershell projects.   
Without their assistance these samples would have been much more complicated and labor intensive.  
What we will demonstrate will try to adhere to 4-12 hours of real world development time.  
You may be tempted to jump right into Provider Hosted Add-Ins or overly complicated projects that require databases, multi-tier structure, API's, security constraints, and unit testing.  
Each of those are great when used in the correct context.   
Not all applications or requirements need to jump to extremly complicated.   
Hopefully at the end of this series you'll have enough sample code and patterns to start new projects with a out of the box mindset first.
